									<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<h3>What is SpiderHacks?</h3>
										<p>SpiderHacks is a hackathon hosted by ACM at UR where you along with other developers, entrepreneurs, and designers work together to create a product. This product can be a web app, a mobile app, whatever!</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>When and where is the event? How do I get there?</h3>
										<p>The event is March 3rd, 2018 from 8:45 am - 9 pm. However, note that events start at 9 am and you will have to register, so be there at 8:45 am. The event is held at University of Richmond at Jepson Hall. Directions to Jepson Hall are below. (Be sure you're not going to Jepson Alumni Center because that's a completely different building!)</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Who can attend?</h3>
										<p>Any current students can attend, but students from UR, VCU, and Deep Run are especially encouraged to attend since they are in the area!</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>How big can the teams be? What if I don't have a team?</h3>
										<p>The teams can be up to 4 people. If you don't have a team, that's okay, you can come alone and we'll do a team matching session at the beginning. You're also welcome to work on a product alone if you want to!</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Will there be travel reimbursements?</h3>
										<p>Unfortunately, there will not be travel reimbursements since it is a local hackathon.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
										<p>If you have a computer, bring that and the charger, and bring your phone.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Will food be provided?</h3>
										<p>Yes! Food will be provided and it will be completely free. If you have any dietary restrictions, be sure to let us know when you register.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>How does judging work?</h3>
										<p>The judges will evaluate your hack based off creativity, polish, and technical vigor. Projects will also be judged on how well they embody the theme they are competing in. Succeed in all three categories, and you're bound to win! (Taken from Hack UVA's website) </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Will there be hardware or other supplies?</h3>
										<p>Unfortunately, no. Since it's a local hackathon, there will not be hardware or other things to build with provided. However, if you need access to a computer, be sure to indicate so when registering.</p>

									<h2>Questions from Hackathon Newbies</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<h3>What's the point of a hackathon?</h3>
										<p>Have you ever had an idea but just couldn't work on it due to resources, time, or just lack of motivation? Now's your chance to try making it! Major League Hacking describes a hackathon as an "invention marathon" if that gives you any idea.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Why should I go?</h3>
										<p>There will be free food, goodies, and prizes! You should also go if you've never been to a hackathon before to see if you like it. Hopefully, this will encourage you to go to bigger, better hackathons! You should also go if you don't like overnight hackathons and just want the experience.</p>
									</li>
									
									<li>
										<h3>What if I'm not that good at programming or I don't know how to make websites/mobile apps?</h3>
										<p>That's okay! Come to the hackathon to learn about these things and to try and create a product. Learning is part of the hackathon experience.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>What if I don't finish?</h3>
										<p>That's also okay! Since it's such a short hackathon, it'll be hard to completely flesh out a product. We want to recognize everyone's hard work, so if you have made some progress or have some features working, we really encourage you to present at product presentations. It's completely okay if you didn't finish.</p>
